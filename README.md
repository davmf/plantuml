PlantUML with specific customisations
=====================================

My goals with this fork are as follows:

 - to improve the appearance of plantuml state diagrams, especially complex ones
 - (in conjunction with some preprocessing in another repo) to allow for hiding
   of selected diagrm elements and links while retaining the overall layout
